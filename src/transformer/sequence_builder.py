"""
Sequence Builder for NBA Transformer Model.

This module constructs the INPUT data for each training sample. The core idea:
    - For a game we want to predict (the "target game"), we look backwards in time
      and fetch the last N completed games for BOTH the home and away teams.
    - This creates a "historical context window" -- the transformer model learns to
      predict game outcomes based on how each team has recently played.

CRITICAL: Strict temporal ordering is enforced throughout. We ONLY look at games
that occurred BEFORE the target game's date. This prevents "data leakage" -- a
common machine learning pitfall where future information accidentally leaks into
the training data, making the model appear better than it really is.

Usage:
    builder = SequenceBuilder(tokenizer, n_games=5)
    sequence_data = builder.build_sequence(target_game_id)
