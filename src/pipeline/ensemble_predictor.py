"""
Ensemble Predictor: combines predictions from multiple individual models.

Reads existing predictions from the Predictions table (written by individual
predictors that have already run), combines them using equal-weight averaging
for spreads/scores and log-odds averaging for win probabilities.

Designed to run LAST in the pipeline, after all individual predictors have
saved their predictions to the DB.

Usage:
    from src.pipeline.ensemble_predictor import EnsemblePredictor
    predictor = EnsemblePredictor()
    preds = predictor.make_pre_game_predictions(["0022500900", "0022500901"])
